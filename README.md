# Changes in Harvard Course Enrollments from 2018-2019

Visualizing changes in Harvard course enrollment data from 2018-2019 using data from the [Harvard FAS Registrar](https://registrar.fas.harvard.edu/faculty-staff/courses/enrollment/archived-course-enrollment-reports). 

This visualization is intended to provide insight for the Harvard administration as to the types of classes that students are increasingly eager to join, which could help to inform future course creation decisions.

Note that data is being actively pulled from the Registrar website, which could result in a change to the graphic if the Registrar alters the databse. The RPubs link, however, is not live updating.
